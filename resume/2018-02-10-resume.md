## [Project Experience]()
---
#### [Terrapin Rockets Development Team](), _Propulsion Team_ Oct. 2017 – Present

- Develop a paraffin and liquid N 2 O hybrid rocket to push a 8.5kg to 30,000 ft. for the Spaceport America Cup
- Modeled and designed a small scale test motor to measure regression rates and thrust of the motor
- Used ANSYS Fluent and Chemkin to simulate combustion chamber regression rates, and calculate predicted
    chamber pressures and temperatures for a small scale test stand

#### [Deployable Heat Shield](), Near-Space Laboratory, _Mechanical Team Leader_ July 2018 – Present

- Design a deployable heat shield to simulate the recovery of an upper stage launch vehicle
- Simulate reentry conditions and flow over heat shield at hypersonic speeds using methods of characteristics and
    Fluent (for lower velocities)
- Heat shield will be dropped from 80,000 ft. to simulate descent through the atmosphere

#### [CanSat Competition 2018 Deployable Heat Shield](), _Mechanical Team Leader_ Oct 2017 – June 2018

- Designed and built a rocket launched probe to test and simulate a deployable heat shield to slow probes descent
- Used ANSYS Fluent CFD simulations of descent rate and stability of probe and heat shield during flight to
    modify the design accurately determine the flight characteristics
- Placed 4th among 104 international teams competing in competition

#### [Flight Controller for Propulsive Landing](), Control of Aerospace Systems May 2018

- Developed a flight control algorithm to land a simulated rocket on a moving barge
- Flight controller implemented noise pre-filtering, external disturbance rejection and second order target tracking

#### [Solar Powered Glider](), _Team Leader_ Nov 2016 – May 2017

- Constructed and designed a solar powered glider designed to take measurements of altitude, velocity, temperature,
    pressure and transmit the data collected during flight to a ground station
- Managed a team of eight students, coordinated work schedules, made deadlines, kept team members on schedule
