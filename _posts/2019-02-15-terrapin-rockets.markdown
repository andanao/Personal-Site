In October 2017 the Terrapin Rockets club started development of a hybrid rocket engine with the hopes of at some point participating in the [Spaceport America Cup's](https://www.spaceportamericacup.com/) Student Research and Design competition.  I was involved in the early stages of development of the team until I graduated in May 2019.  

The team first began researching possible avenues for development, a liquid rocket test stand had been built in one of the labs but had never been succesfully fired before, however documentation and details on its functionality were difficult to find.  The other option considered was to develop a hybrid rocket, solid motors were not considered because **¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯**.  

Through reading recent research on the development of hybrid rocket motors, it was determined that paraffin and N<sub>2</sub>O would be optimal choices for the fuel and oxidizer combination.  Various other fuel options were considered, including HTPB, however paraffin was selected due to its superior efficiency and regression rates.  The selection of oxidizers was limited due to requirement set forth by the competition and the university, no oxidizer which would require a breathing apparatus to safely handle or low temperature could be used.  As such N<sub>2</sub>O was selected since it was the most readily and cheaply avaliable oxidizer that met these criteria.

Once the oxidizer and fuel were both selected, work began on designing a small low thrust engine to try and understand the processes behind building, designing and running a hybrid rocket motor and test stand.  The small motor was to have a target thrust of 200 lbf. and be easily modifiable for changing designs.  

I worked on determining the charachteristics of combustion of the paraffin fuel grain.  

read through cantwell's [chapter](https://web.stanford.edu/~cantwell/AA283_Course_Material/AA283_Course_Notes/AA283_Aircraft_and_Rocket_Propulsion_Ch_11_BJ_Cantwell.pdf), sutton's book, various other research papers (including cantwell's research) 

Simulated the stuff using method of charachteristics approach? in MATLAB

Modelled what was going on in an ANSYS simulation (kinda a lie)

Once the design was completed towards the spring of 2018, I moved more into a backseat role in the team, teaching newcomers to the team about how the simulations would wokr, where to find information, where to go for help and just general knowledge on things, mostly helping out where needed as the process of building the things slowly went through.
