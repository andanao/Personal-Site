## draft

This project originally began from a group of students interested in being part of the Cansat Competition 2017, with the goal of designing a solar powered glider that would launch from a rocket and take and transmit measurements during its descent. I volunteered to lead the group which taught me valuable lessons in group managment and communication skills.

The original designs required the glider to fit within a canister, requiring folding wings and locking them out.  As the project moved forwards interest in the competition waned, and it was decided that there were still enough people left in the group interested in trying to build a glider that could power all of its electronics using solar panels. With this change longer and deeper wings were added and made lighter allowing more room for solar panels and a better flight profile.

During the process of designing and building the glider, I worked on CAD model for the body of the glider, however most of the work I did was trying to manage the group in getting schedules to work together and trying to complete the project before finals for the spring semester would come around, since it seemed likely that people would lose intersest as they went away for the summer and wouldn't be intereste in continuing work on the glider one classes resumed for the fall semester.  As such the testing schedule was moved forwards to allow for more time to test the glider to make it functional.

However in the first test flights over grass, the testing did not go well, with the glider stalling and veering away from the grassy hill we had been testing on into the concrete, resulting in a compeltely destroyed glider (fortuantely the electronics survived).  Faced with the setback of a completely destroyed glider and little data, most people quit the team and the development of the glider stopped with its final test flight.

While the project itself was a failure,  it turned out to be a learning experience for me, teaching me what I should and should not do when it comes to managing group projects and working with other peopel schedules.  With the benefit of hindsight and having worked in groups that functioned better, many of the problems that were encountered during development that led to the rushed testing schedule, could have been avoided with better team communication and scheduling of meetings and times to work on the glider so that testing could have happened earlier. The rushed testing schedule also meand that the testing procedures weren't fully fleshed out when it came time to test the glider partly leading to the failure of the glider and the project.
