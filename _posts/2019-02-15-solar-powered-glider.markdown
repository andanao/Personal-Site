## draft

This project originally began from a group of students interested in being part of the Cansat Competition 2017, with the goal of designing a solar powered glider that would launch from a rocket and take and transmit measurements during its descent.

The original designs required the glider to fit within a canister, requiring folding wings and locking them out.  As the project moved forwards interest in the competition waned, and it was decided that there were still enough people left in the group interested in trying to build a glider that could power all of its electronics using solar panels.
