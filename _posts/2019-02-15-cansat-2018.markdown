<!-- What Cansat is, what that years thing was

What I was responsible for doing

Design and build (fuuuck just 2 ppl)

Testing process (yay for a failed parachute (idk if this should be in there honestly maybe just write a thing about how it was tested and how you verified your shitty aerodynamics CFD (lots of guesswork)))

Actual Competition

Results -->

[Cansat](http://www.cansatcompetition.com/) is an annual student design build and fly competition focused on space-related topics.  In 2018 Competition, goal of the competition was to create a deployable heat shield that would be launched from a rocket **add Conops picture** and be capable of recordingand capturing data during its descent.  A team of 6 student researchers (including myself) decided to enter the competition because the University of Maryland's [Space Systems Lab](http://spacecraft.ssl.umd.edu) has done research on deployable heat shields for atmospheric reentry <sup>[1](https://spacecraft.ssl.umd.edu/publications/pub_index.html#1998) [2](https://spacecraft.ssl.umd.edu/publications/pub_index.html#1990)</sup> and since 2017 has had active research into development of deployable heat shield concepts
