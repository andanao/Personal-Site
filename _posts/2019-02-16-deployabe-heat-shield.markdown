## draft

Continuation on the research done at the University of Maryland's Space Systems Laboratory on deployable heat shields.

As a student researcher witht the University of Maryland Space Systems Lab, I was part of a team working on the research and development of a deployable heat shield concept to return an orbiting payload bakc to earth.  The proposal is a **cubesat return mission?** *read teh TARDIS paper* which would bring back a cubesat from orbit.

I was involved in designing and simulating the aero stuff (kinda had no idea what I was doing), the supersonic aero stuff was super handwavy and idk what the hell I was doing, but hey I tried.

The paper I co-authored was accepted for oral presentation in a [technical session](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amz.xcdsystem.com/4F14E44B-BC41-E69B-DFAF5A1B1627A0EA_abstract_File14318/PDFUpload_108_0726105549.pdf) on Free Flyers and Deployables during the 2019 International Space Station Research and Development Conference.
